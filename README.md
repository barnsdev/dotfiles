4. Symbolically link (symlink) the files in this repo back to where they need to be on the system.

    See below for these locations:

    1. `zshrc`, this should be to your $HOME directory:

        ```

    2. `.config/karabiner`, this should be the same path in your $HOME directory:

        ```sh
        ln -fns $HOME/_src/z_dotfiles/dotfiles/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json $HOME/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json
